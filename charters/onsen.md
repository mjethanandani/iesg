# Operationalizing Network & SErvice abstractioNs (ONSEN) WG Charter

Large networks rely on service abstraction mechanisms — for example, VPNs, service function chains, traffic engineering, attachment circuits, and network slicing — to deliver differentiated services and simplify provisioning. As the [IAB NEMOPS workshop](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-iab-nemops-workshop-report/) highlighted, operational workflows for deploying, monitoring, and evolving these abstractions are inconsistent and poorly integrated, despite much of the underlying IETF prior work.

The ONSEN WG aims to make IETF service and network abstractions easier to implement and use, improving automation, operational efficiency, and interoperability. 

For this WG, the term "abstraction" refers to the process of defining simplified, high-level constructs that represent network and service-level capabilities. Abstraction enables interaction between managed components and automation management systems without directly exposing the underlying device-specific implementations.

ONSEN will serve as the IETF's focal point for service and network abstraction modeling, with four core activities:

1. Documenting the operational needs and motivations for network and service abstractions.
1. Coordinating abstraction work, using device-level YANG models as the basis for the abstraction.
1. Maintaining key YANG data models, including refactoring or restructuring, which includes at least the following: VPN Common Model, L2VPN Service Model (L2SM), L3VPN Service Model (L3SM), L2VPN Network Model (L2NM), L3VPN Network Model (L3NM), Attachment Circuit Common Model, Attachment Circuit-as-a-Service (ACaaS), Attachment Circuit Network Model, Service Attachment Points (SAP), Network Slicing, Service Assurance for Intent-Based Networking (SAIN), Virtual Network (VN), Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN), and the YANG Data Model for Network and VPN Service Performance Monitoring.
1. Developing reusable abstractions and a common foundation for service YANG data models that allow multiple IETF service models to be built on a shared, extensible foundation.

The WG may develop new service or network YANG data models related to IETF technologies when gaps are identified.

Beyond these, ONSEN will define service-layer APIs based on YANG service models to interface with OSS/BSS, enabling automated and interoperable service orchestration across systems and vendors. This includes defining mechanisms and approaches for integrating IETF YANG data models with external frameworks (e.g., TMF640) and external systems (e.g., network source of truth, IP address management). Abstractions, the RFC 8969 framework, and service model explanations in RFC 8309 will be assessed against real-world deployment use cases to identify any gaps and develop solutions in conjunction with the relevants WG(s).

The WG will catalogue tooling resources (tools, gaps, recommendations, implementation examples, hackathon artifacts) in the WG GitHub and/or Wiki, and actively encourage participation in hackathons and interoperability events.

## Work Items

1. Develop a problem statement to define the scope and priorities for the other work items
1. Update the YANG network data models for L3NM and L2NM
1. Update the YANG service data models for L3SM and L2SM
1. Develop reusable service YANG data models
1. Define the interface between YANG-based service APIs and the OSS/BSS layer

The WG may decide that some documents should remain as Internet-Drafts rather than get published as RFCs. This decision will be made on a case-by-case basis by consensus of the WG.

## Relationship With Existing WGs

* Technology or protocol-specific modeling efforts (e.g., device-level YANG data models) remain the responsibility of their respective WGs.
* ONSEN WG will engage with other relevant WGs (e.g., NETMOD and NMOP) to gather requirements and input related to tooling.
* Any new requirements for changes to the YANG language that are identified during ONSEN WG discussions will be directed to the NETMOD WG for consideration.
* BESS/CCAMP/TEAS: ONSEN WG will take on future network and service data modeling efforts, while technology or protocol-specific modeling efforts remain in these WGs.
* NMOP: ONSEN WG will focus on abstractions, while topology-related efforts will remain in NMOP. Network topology models are out of scope of ONSEN.
* OPSAWG: ONSEN WG will handle AC/SAP/L2NM/L3NM work, enabling OPSAWG to focus on other operational topics. Future abstraction-related work will be directed to ONSEN.
